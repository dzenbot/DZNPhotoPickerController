/** 
 A photo search/picker for iOS 7, similar to UIImagePickerControl, providing photos from popular photography like 500px, Flickr and many others.
 This framework tries to mimic as close as possible the native UIImagePickerController API for iOS7, in terms of features, appearance and behaviour.
 
 @discussion Due to Terms of Use of some photo services, the images can only be cached in memory, but not the device's hard drive.
