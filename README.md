A photo search/picker for iOS using popular image providers like 500px, Flickr, Instagram, Giphy, Google & Bing Images, combined with a minimalistic image cropper inspired from UIImagePickerController's.

## Feature List
* Search photos on mutiple service providers (500px, Flickr, Giphy, Instagram, Google Images & Bing Images)
* Auto-completed typing for easier search (using Flickr's API as a common denominator).
* Present the photo picker with a pre-defined search term to automatically start searching.
* Exact same UI layouts and behaviours than UIImagePickerController.
* Edit photo selections with cropping guides : square, circular (like the Contacts app) and custom size.
* Cropping mecanism compatible with UIImagePickerController (check on UIImagePickerController+Edit).
* Infinite scrolling (optional).
* Creative Commons licences optional filtering.
* App Store safe. Innapropriate content disabled for all services.
* Option for disabling full sized photo download and retrieving metadata only.
* iOS 8 and 9. iPhone 4/5/6 and iPad support.
* Localization support (UI strings use NSLocalizedString but it's up to you to localize them on your app)

## Installation

###### With [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/):
```ruby
pod "DZNPhotoPickerController"
```

Dependencies:
- AFNetworking
- SDWebImage
- DZNEmptyDataSet

## How to use
For complete documentation, [visit CocoaPods' auto-generated doc](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/DZNPhotoPickerController/)

### Import

```
#import <DZNPhotoPickerController/DZNPhotoPickerController.h>
```

### Registration
Before even creating a new instance of DZNPhotoPickerController, it is recommended that you register to the photo services APIs your will need, on your UIViewController's class method +initialize, like so:
```
+ (void)initialize
{
    [DZNPhotoPickerController registerService:DZNPhotoPickerControllerService500px
                                  consumerKey:YOUR_500px_KEY
                               consumerSecret:YOUR_500px_SECRET
                                 subscription:DZNPhotoPickerControllerSubscriptionFree];
    
    [DZNPhotoPickerController registerService:DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceFlickr
                                  consumerKey:YOUR_Flickr_KEY
                               consumerSecret:YOUR_Flickr_SECRET
                                 subscription:DZNPhotoPickerControllerSubscriptionFree];
}
```

### Initialisation
Creating a new instance of DZNPhotoPickerController is very similar to what you would do with UIImagePickerController:
```
DZNPhotoPickerController *picker = [[DZNPhotoPickerController alloc] init];
picker.supportedServices = DZNPhotoPickerControllerService500px | DZNPhotoPickerControllerServiceFlickr;
picker.allowsEditing = YES;
picker.delegate = self;
    
[self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
````

You can additionally set more properties:
```
picker.initialSearchTerm = @"Surf";
picker.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropModeCircular;
picker.enablePhotoDownload = YES;
picker.supportedLicenses = DZNPhotoPickerControllerCCLicenseBY_ALL;
picker.allowAutoCompletedSearch = YES;
picker.infiniteScrollingEnabled = YES;
```

You can opt-in for block methods instead of using the delegate's methods:
```
picker.finalizationBlock = ^(DZNPhotoPickerController *picker, NSDictionary *info) {
    //Your implementation here
};
    
picker.failureBlock = ^(DZNPhotoPickerController *picker, NSError *error) {
    //Your implementation here
};
    
picker.cancellationBlock = ^(DZNPhotoPickerController *picker) {
    //Your implementation here
};
```


## Standalone Image Editor

You can install it as a subspec (if you're not using `DZNPhotoPickerController`)
```
pod 'DZNPhotoPickerController/Editor'
```

If you already have an image to edit, simply do:
```
DZNPhotoEditorViewController *editor = [[DZNPhotoEditorViewController alloc] initWithImage:self.myImage];
editor.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropModeCustom;
editor.cropSize = CGSizeMake(CGRectGetWidth(self.view.frame), 200.0);

[editor setAcceptBlock:^(DZNPhotoEditorViewController *editor, NSDictionary *userInfo){
        
    //Your implementation here
}];
    
[editor setCancelBlock:^(DZNPhotoEditorViewController *editor){
        
    //Your implementation here
}];

// The view controller requieres to be nested in a navigation controller
UINavigationController *controller = [[UINavigationController alloc] initWithRootViewController:navigation];
[self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];
````

## Circular and Custom Edition
Another great feature of DZNPhotoPickerController is to allow circular edit mode when using UIImagePickerController, just like the Contact app when editing a user's avatar image. *Please note that the circular mode still exports a squared image since it's sole purpose is for croping alignment. If you need to present a circular image in your app, you will need to implement it yourself.*

<br>
Its use is really straightforward:

```
UIImagePickerController *picker = [[UIImagePickerController alloc] init];
picker.allowsEditing = YES;
picker.sourceType = UIImagePickerControllerSourceTypePhotoLibrary;
picker.delegate = self;
picker.cropMode = DZNPhotoEditorViewControllerCropModeCircular;
    
[self presentViewController:picker animated:YES completion:nil];
```

## Block Support
There is also block support for UIImagePickerController! It replaces the 2 traditional delegate methods with 2 block properties instead:
```
picker.finalizationBlock = ^(UIImagePickerController *picker, NSDictionary *info) {
    //Your implementation here
};
    
picker.cancellationBlock = ^(UIImagePickerController *picker) {
     //Your implementation here
};
```
